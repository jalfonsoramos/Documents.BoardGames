## Fighting Style

### Archery

You gain a +2 bonus to Attack rolls you make with Ranged Weapons.

### Ranger Archetype

#### Primeval Awareness

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): Aberrations, Celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, Fiends, and Undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.

#### Hunter

Hunter’s Prey

Horde Breaker: Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon Attack, you can make another Attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

Extra Attack
At 5th level, you are one of the fastest shooters around, when you take the attack action you gain a 2nd attack

Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.

Sharpest of Shooters
At 6th level. You're one the best snipers around; you're both accurate and deadly. You gain the Sharpshooter feat. If you already had this feat, you may gain a new feat in its place. Additionally, instead of taking a -5 to your attack roll to add +10 to your damage roll, you take -2 to the attack roll instead.
